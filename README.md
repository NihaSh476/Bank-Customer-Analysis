##  Bank Customer Analysis
The project aims to analyze bank customer data and visualize key insights using Power BI.
##  Problem Statement:
The bank seeks to understand and analyze customer data to improve retention strategies and enhance customer satisfaction. By utilizing bank data encompassing various attributes such as age, balance, gender, job classification, and region, the bank aims to identify key trends and insights into customer behavior. Specifically, the bank desires to examine balance distribution, customer demographics, and job classification insights.
##  Key Insights:
This analysis provides insights into customer segments based on factors like:
•	Gender-based balance distribution
•	Age-based balance trends
•	Customer distribution by job classification
•	Regional customer segmentation
•	Total customer count and segment proportions
##  Data Collection and Cleaning:
1.	Gather bank data, including attributes such as gender, age, balance, job classification, and region.
2.	Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
•	Analyze balance trends by gender and age.
•	Study customer distribution by job classification and region.
##  Visualization:
Utilize Power BI visualizations such as line charts, pie charts, and bar plots to represent:
1.	Balance by Gender: Display the balance distribution for male and female customers using pie charts.
2.	Balance by Age: Visualize how customer balance varies across different age groups using a line chart.
3.	Customers by Age Group and Gender: Compare customer count distribution across different age groups and genders using bar charts.
4.	Customer Distribution by Job Classification: Show job classification breakdown (White Collar, Blue Collar, Other) using pie charts.
5.	Number of Customers by Region: Analyze customer distribution across different regions using pie charts.
##  Expected Outcome:
1.	A clear understanding of balance distribution by gender and age.
2.	Insightful visualizations depicting customer segmentation by job classification and region.
3.	Identification of key factors influencing customer behavior and financial engagement with the bank.
